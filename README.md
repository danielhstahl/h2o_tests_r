## Tests for h2o in R

This is a simple repo to show how to perform classification using DL and XGBoost in R using H2O.  

Note that the H2O package abstracts factors in a DMatrix nicely.  This is a big improvement over the manual DMatrix work performed in my [xgboost](https://github.com/phillyfan1138/xgboost_r_test) test work.
